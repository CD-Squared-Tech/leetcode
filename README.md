# leetcode
Respository for the winners in time and memory for leetcode soltions.

# Structure
Each leetcode problem is listed by number, if you have a solution please put it under the number followed by the language. 
In order to be the specified winner that gets eventually pulled you have to beat others, please post three screenshots showing the time
and memory usage in your pull request. Time and memory are weighted 50/50 IE top 90% speed, top 5% memory usage, 0.9 * 0.05 = 0.045 <- your score. 
The three will be averaged together for your final score.


# Rules
You can look at other peoples solutions, what you can't do is copy their solution. 

What constitutes Copying: 
- Changing variable names without changing anything else 
- Formating the code differently, ie if I format and they look exactly the same it's copying
- Copying entire sections of code without changing the underlying behavior
- Any combination of the three above. 

# Winners: 
After you win and your code is merged you will need to make a second pull request ammending your code with explicit detail of 
the thought process behind your solution. It should contain: 
- General comments stepping through major parts of the code. 
- Explicit detail of magic numbers. 
- Escapes returning early values
- Bonus points: Time and memory complexity. 

In addition your verified time/memory usage for the three submissions need to be commented at the top of your main function ie
//run number: speed number, memory usage number;
//r1: 50%, 32%;
//r2: 60%, 38%;
//r3: 10%, 92%;
